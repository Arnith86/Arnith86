## Welcome! My name is Jean-Paul Hanna, and this is my portfolio! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="35px">


I am a newly graduated Software Engineer (class of 2024) based in Sweden. My primary expertise lies in backend development, but I am always eager to expand my skill set. I thrive on tackling programming challenges that push me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to discover innovative and efficient solutions while continually learning and growing.
